# RecipeBuddy

A Flutter project.

## Getting Started

RecipeBuddy is a Flutter-based mobile app that helps users find recipes using ingredients they already have. By inputting ingredients, users receive AI-powered recipe recommendations, each with clear step-by-step instructions. The purpose of this application is twofold: 
To serve users who want to explore new recipes across different cuisines. 
To help everyday users reduce food waste by recommending dishes they can make with ingredients they already have.
